# Github Repository Pet Project with Javascript

GitHub Data Retriever is a small application that retrieves data from the Stack Builders organization on GitHub using GitHub's public API. The application displays:

- Repositories with more than 5 stars.
- The last 5 updated repositories.
- The sum of all repository stars.

## Feautures

- Each functionality is implemented as a separate function.
